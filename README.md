CSS Ion Icons
=================

> v1.0.0 (2020-05-14)

__Download [Ion Icons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons) 
and run `icon.php` on e.g. localhost. 
It will read SVG icons from the folder `ion` and build css from it.
Now you can use the `ion.css` without the SVG Icons!__

*HINT: Only SVGs that don't use style="" tag can be converted!*
